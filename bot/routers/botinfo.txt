hi!
thatrack is an application for tracking study and work time. for instance, you study a lot 
(or, it just seems to you that you study a lot), and you want to track this time.

everything you need, is authenticate, create a new <b>tag</b> and start a new <b>session</b>

<b>what's a tag?</b>
users can divide their study & work session into different categories, i named it tags. you can add an icon for your tag for better view.

<b>what's a session?</b>
session - it is time when you study. when you start a new session, you choose a tag for it, 
(like what are you doing during this session). then, you can pause it as much times as you need, or finish this session.
after that, you will get information about this session: tag, start time, end time and breaks time
